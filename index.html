				`"You are a special human being. Basic bitch 90s Americana societal philosophy tells everyone that they are special, but statistically, they are not. It is literally impossible for every organism on this planet to be special based on the unique properties of being themselves, yet you have already crushed it in this sector. You are an outlier on the bell curve, so here is my limited advice/words of shitty wisdom at my age.

					(1) If it's become easy, your growth rate has slowed - and at some point, you might be okay with that / that might be what's best. Don't take ease as a bad thing though... it also ebbs and flows and sometimes you need to chill and recalibrate before going HAM again ❤️
					(2) Your true friends will always be your friends. This goes past job titles, social standing... and even time will tell. Your interactions may be different due to life events (age, jobs, babies, moves, deaths, cult-joinings, crossfit/SoulCycle addictions, etc etc) , but if your soul "sees" another soul - you'll search for and adapt to new forms of communication to keep connecting.  I think you already know this as you are wise beyond your years. But, please see point 3
					(3) I have no advice to dump on you because you intuitively know it all - your journey is less about calibrating your compass (it's fine-tuned), and more about figuring out when you want to listen and when it's worth going rogue." - Euni`,
				`"I believe in you. Do not doubt yourself in this time." - Lily`,
				`"COACHES DON'T PLAY" - Lily`,

				`"Sophia, you are the epitome of growth mindset!! When things get rough, you’re always the shining beacon of optimism and hope that I look to! With your spirit and positive attitude, you can do anything ❤️" - Shreya`,
